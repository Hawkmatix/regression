Copyright 2012, 2013 Andrew Hawkins.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this file, but changing it is not allowed.

============================================================

Note: It is important to remember that this program was written as a library
for NinjaTrader and uses the NinjaTrader API, commonly referred to as NinjaScript.
This program, in its current form, cannot run independently from NinjaTrader.

Installation from Binary
========================

Note: Not all projects have binanry files available. If the source packeage does not
include a bin subfile then you will have to use the "Compiling from Source" either
method 1 or 2 to install the project.

1. Open NinjaTrader.

2. In the Control Center click File, Utilities, then Import NinjaScript...

3. A window will pop up asking you if the file is from a trusted source. Click Yes.

4. Locate and select the binary file then click Open. This file will likely be in your
Downloads. It also must be unzipped. I will be in the subfolder bin and named ...Revise


Compiling from Source, Method 1
===============================

1. Locate the source file for the project. It is likely to be in your Downloads.
You must unzip the containing file. It will be in the subfolder src and named HawkmatixPROJECT.cs
with PROJECT being the name of the project (ex. IntradayPivots, Distribution, etc.).

2. Select the file and copy it, either by right clicking or Ctrl+C.

3. Locate the NinjaTrader indicator folder in your Documents. This varies from machine
to machine but it is likely to be along the path Documents/NinjaTrader 7/bin/Custom/Indicator.

4. Paste the previously copied file into this folder.

5. Now that this file is in the correct place you must recompile all indicators so that
NinjaTrader can rewrite the DLL file. Do this by Opening NinjaTrader.

6. In the Control Center click Tools, Edit NinjaScript, then Indicator...

7. Select any indicator from the list then click OK.

8. Finally, press the compile button in the top tool bar.

9. Now the project will be available for use.

Compiling from Source, Method 2
===============================

Note: Method 1 is the preferred method. If you are having trouble using method 1 then
feel free to use this method. It is slightly more complicated and should take more time.

1. Open NinjaTrader.

2. In the Control Center click Tools, New NinjaScript, then Indicator...

3. When the new frame pops up click Next>.

4. On the next screen it will ask to enter a name. It is important that you
input the name exactly the same as the file. So if the file is HawkmatixIntradayPivots.cs
you must enter HawkmatixIntradayPivots as the name.

5. After the name has been entered click Generate. A script file will open with a
default template.

6. Locate and open the source file for the project. It is likely to be in your
Downloads. You must unzip the containing file. It will be in the subfolder src and named
HawkmatixPROJECT.cs with PROJECT being the name of the project (ex. IntradayPivots,
Distribution, etc.).

7. Once you have opened the source file select all and copy the contents of the file.
You can do this with Ctrl+A then Ctrl+C.

8. Return to default template script and select all and delete the contents of the file.
You can do this with Ctrl+A then Del.

9. Finally, paste the contents into the script and press the compile button in the
top tool bar.

10. You can now close the file and the project will be available for use.
